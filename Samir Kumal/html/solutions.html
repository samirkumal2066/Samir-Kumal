    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i> Electric Vehicles</h2>
    <section class="electric">
        <img src="../images/EVs.jpg" alt="" class="ev">
        <p class="explain">The use of electric vehicles (EVs) is a key solution to combat global warming by reducing
            greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Unlike traditional gasoline or diesel-powered cars,
            EVs run on electricity, producing zero tailpipe emissions. When powered by renewable energy sources like
            solar or wind, their environmental impact is drastically minimized. EVs help decrease dependence on fossil
            fuels, improve air quality, and contribute to a sustainable, low-carbon future. As battery technology and
            charging infrastructure improve, the widespread adoption of EVs can play a major role in slowing climate
            change.</p>

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i> Afforestation</h2>
    <section class="plant">
        <p class="explanation">Afforestation, the process of planting trees in areas that were not previously forested,
            is a powerful natural solution to global warming. Trees absorb carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) from the atmosphere
            through photosynthesis, storing it in their trunks, branches, and roots. Large-scale tree planting
            initiatives can play a vital role in offsetting emissions, slowing climate change, and building climate
            resilience for future generations.

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i> Use of organic fertilizers</h2>
    <section class="manure">
        <img src="../images/fertilizer.jpg" alt="" class="good">
        <p class="summary">The use of organic fertilizers is a sustainable agricultural practice that helps reduce
            global warming. Unlike synthetic fertilizers, which are energy-intensive to produce and release high levels
            of nitrous oxide potent greenhouse gas organic fertilizers such as compost, manure, and biofertilizers
            have a lower carbon footprint. They enrich the soil naturally, enhancing its ability to store carbon and
            support microbial life. By improving soil health and reducing the need for chemical inputs, organic
            fertilizers contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions and promote long-term climate resilience in
            agriculture.

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i> Use of sustainable energy</h2>
    <section class="solar">
        <p class="summarize">
            Sustainable energy such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal plays a crucial role in reducing the
            effects of global warming. By replacing fossil fuels, it significantly cuts carbon dioxide and methane
            emissions, which are the main drivers of climate change. Unlike coal or oil, sustainable energy sources are
            clean, renewable, and virtually unlimited. Widespread adoption of sustainable energy reduces air pollution,
            lowers global temperatures, and promotes long-term energy security. Transitioning to sustainable energy is
            one of the most effective ways to combat global warming and protect the planet for future generations.
